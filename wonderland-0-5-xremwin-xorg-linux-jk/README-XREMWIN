Wonderland Release 0.5
Linux version Build 3

This is the source code for the Xremwin server for Wonderland for
Release 0.5. This is a version of the Xorg server (based on Xvfb)
which provides information on windows to the Wonderland client, using
a protocol called Xremwin.  Xremwin is similar the remote protocol
used by VNC. The main difference is that it has been extended to
support the transmission of data about multiple individual windows
rather than the entire desktop.

This code is based on Xorg 7.3, but it can probably be easily ported
to newer versions of Xorg as they come along.

1. Creating the code base

First bring over an Xorg source tree from the X.org git repository or using 
tarballs. Refer to the Xorg developer instructions on freedesktop.org for
details on how to do this.

Next, take the code from the end of dix/events.c starting with "#define REMWIN"
and add it to the end of your dix/events.c.

Next, take the code fragments between "#ifdef REMWIN" and "#endif /* REMWIN */"
from the files hw/vfb/{InitInput.c,InitOutput.c,lk201kbd.h} and apply them
to the equivalent places to the Xorg copies of these files.

2. Configure the build

This package includes an updated Makefile.in for the hw/vfb directory. For Xorg
7.3, you should be able to replace the Makefile.in from the distribution with
the provided file, and re-run configure to generate an updated Makefile.

In addition, you will need to modify the Makefile in the dix directory to
include the -DREMWIN as a compile flag.

3. Building the code base

Build the codebase normally using "make".  The Wonderland Xvfb executable will be 
generated in the hw/vfb directory.  To use this executable in Wonderland, replace
the version in
~/.wonderland-server/<version>/run/shared_app_server/run/bin/<platform>/Xvfb-xremwin
with an updated version.  To package, include the updated file in the Wonderland
source file
wonderland/modules/foundation/sasxremwin/lib/zip/xremwin.zip
